Thanks for the opportunity! 

Please read this for some comments when it comes to understand all the requirements!

One of the assumptions I had to make was about the two exposed service calls! On the same line it said that I could stub the  data. I did. I have a local JSON file with around 15 cars, where I did include, on the same file, the “availability”. So, I did add any “offline” checks for networks and etc. I just used the JSON to retrieve the data.

Another thing I did, is, I saved the images locally so I did not download them from a URL. I used the string name to retrieve the image from a assets file, where I added some images I had. (Used from a personal project I did for Nissan cars)

I was a little confused about the service calls versus stubbed data. I did add one of my classes that I have used to retrieve data from a Google Engine server I have so I could expose that I have done work with aSync service calls.
